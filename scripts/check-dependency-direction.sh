# scripts/check-dependency-direction.sh — STD-02 R1–R6, R16, R17 for this workspace.
#
# Two layers of checks, both from source files alone (no build, no network,
# no jq), so the gate runs in `make ci-fast`:
#
#   1. Crate edges. Every workspace crate needs a policy below. A crate may
#      depend only on the internal crates in its allowlist, and never on the
#      external crates in its banlist. Dev-dependencies are exempt. A crate
#      without a policy fails the check, so a new member forces a decision.
#   2. Module edges inside a crate, as grep bans over non-test sources.
#
# The layer order is written down in ARCHITECTURE.md; change it and this
# script in the same commit (STD-02 R6).
